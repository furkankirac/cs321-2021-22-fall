// ---- READ CAREFULLY ----
// During the exam, you MUST upload your code's snapshots at 16:30, 17:30, and finally 18:30 or before the exam ends.
// ALWAYS CHECK YOUR UPLOADED CODE BY DOWNLOADING IT BACK FROM THE LMS.
// IN CASE OF A PROBLEM, EMAIL YOUR SNAPSHOT TO THE INSTRUCTOR AND ALL TEACHING ASSISTANTS.

// A snapshot is the *.cpp file of your solution at a specific time.
// 1st snapshot is at 16:30 (16:20-16:40 range is fine):
// Snapshot itself will be graded as 10 points if everything compiles, 5 points if not.
// Not submitting a snapshot costs you (minus) -25 points.
// 2nd snapshot is at 17:30 (17:20-17:40 range is fine):
// This snapshot must show at least a tiny improvement on Snapshot 1.
// Otherwise it will be considered as not uploaded.
// Snapshot itself will be graded as 10 points if everything compiles, 5 points if not.
// Not submitting or submitting the same snapshot as 1st one costs you (minus) -25 points.
// 3rd snapshot is the completed exam. This code must definitely compile for us to grade it!
// This snapshot will not be given grades itself. This snapshot can be the same with the 2nd snapshot, no problem.
// For extra exam rules, please look at the "main" function below.

    // Q1a (5pts): Write initval1 correctly to match with the console output given.
    // Q1b (5pts): Write lambda1 correctly to match with the console output given.

    // Q2: Accumulate a vector of strings in such a way that strings are clustered according to their length.
    // This means that strings with a lendth of L will be accumulated in Lth container in the returned container of containers.
    // Check the console output for more informative understanding.
    // Hint: std::vector has a resize(int) method that dynamically allocates different number of item slots at run-time.
    // Q2a (5pts): Write initval2 correctly.
    // Q2b (20pts): Write lambda2 correctly.

    // Q3: Filter the container such that only the clusters of strings that are non-empty stays.
    // Q3a (5pts): Write lambda_filter correctly.

    // Q4: Write a print_ overload-set that matches the supplied console output.
    // Q4a (10pts) print_(result_filtered[0]); matches with the console output given.
    // Q4b (5pts) print_(result_filtered[0][0]); matches with the console output given.
    // Q4c (15pts) print_(result_filtered); matches with the console output given. Be careful about the indentations depending on the level.
    // Q4d (10pts) print_(result_filtered[0], result_filtered[0][0], result_filtered); matches with the console output given.
    //      In this question, variable input version of print_ free-function writes "Printing item 1", "Printing item 2", ...
    //      kind of extra lines when compared with the above print_ that prints single thing at a time. Do not miss that.
    // Hint: Be careful, std::string is also a container! std::string is implemented as a container of "char"s in std library.
    //       So, IsContainer concept returns true for std::string type as well.
